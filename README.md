## Purpose
Simulates a discussion in natural language to display the use for artificial intelligence. It reduces or removes the need for addressing repetitive tasks via human intervention.

## Method
I modeled a scene that represents the aftermath of a flood, with models to represent huamn bodies, water puddles and scattered debris. I modified the bubbleRob robot to add an infrared laser which is used to detect the heat, a sensor laser to detect water, and an ultrasonic sensor to detect the building debris. The robot gathers knowledge from the sensors to decide its recovery path, and then uses the results of the sensors to decide which set of instructions to follow. By default, it will follow an uncertain path until something changes, then it will use reasoning to decide what to do next.

## Reflection
To improve the chatbotâ€™s performance, I'd add a more in-depth analysis with more questions and career options.
I would also add the ability to schedule an appointment from available times with a guidance counselor.
